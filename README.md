###### Instructions

1. Check your google classroom account regularly for announcements, lecture slides, course materials etc.
2. Your attendance and how long you have stayed in google meet for each class will be recorded.

# Rationale of the course
To explore complex systems in electrical engineering, one requires computational methods since real life
mathematical models can rarely be solved algebraically. Such methods include techniques for solution of a
complex function, function optimization, integration of function, interpolation from known value to unknown
value, and computer algorithm to solve systems of equations or differential equations. This course aims to
develop necessary skills required by the students for numerical solution of complex engineering problems.

# Course Objectives:

1. Perform error analysis for various numerical methods.
2. Apply different numerical techniques to find solution of a function and the area under the function.
3. Optimize a function using appropriate numerical method.
4. Interpolate a function from known to unknown.
5. Solve systems of equations using numerical techniques.
6. Solve eigen-value problems using numerical techniques.

###### Outcomes: [CO]
At the end of the course, the students are expected to

1. Apply numerical techniques to solve engineering problems.
2. Compare different numerical techniques based on prescribed criteria.
3. Explain the effects of approximations in numerical analysis.
4. Apply computational tools to analyze and design engineering problems.

###### Class Policy:

- Students are required to attend at least 80% of the classes. The instructor may not allow a student
    to attend classes if he/she is absent in more than 20% of the scheduled classes. Students must keep
    the instructor informed regarding absence due to circumstances beyond the students control.
- Zero tolerance policy of EWU regarding academic dishonesty will be strictly enforced.
- No makeup for quizzes
- Makeup exam for midterms and final may be arranged for convincing reasons. The student must apply
    according to the rules of the department with supporting documents.
