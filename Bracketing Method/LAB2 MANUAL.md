## Experiment 02: Root Finding Using Bracketing Method
# PROBLEM TO SOLVE:
Consider the following circuit. We know that, *I<sub>D</sub>* =
*I<sub>S</sub> e<sup>(V/V<sub>T</sub>)*, where *I<sub>S</sub> = 10−12A* and *V<sub>T </sub>= 0.026V.*
Given: *V<sub>DD</sub> = 5V* and *R = 2Ω*.

We want to find *I<sub>D</sub>*, so this is our target variable *‘x’.*
Write the *KVL* find the equation such that *f(x)* = 0.

Make an initial guess of *x<sub>l</sub>= 2* and *x<sub>u</sub> = 3 A*.

### REPORT:
1. Plot *f(x)* using MATLAB or wolfram. Is initial guess of *x<sub>l</sub>*= 2 and *x<sub>u</sub>* = 3 A correct?
2. Write a **MATLAB** code to calculate the root of the function using false position method.
3. Solutions:

a. What is your solution after 10 iterations?

b. What is the true solution found from wolfram?

c. Find relative true error using the solution after 10-iterations.

4. Plot relative apparent error vs. iteration.
